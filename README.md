Interfacing  with traCI : 

-	TraCI could be accessed using multiple programming languages, with the most common language being Python. The package tools/TraCl in the SUMO simulator allows users to interact with SUMO using Python. This is advantageous as Python is already a well established script language for machine learning, providing useful libraries (such as Numpy and Pandas) whilst implementing a machine learning algorithm.

-	With this interfacing we can do a lot of things like : V2X , platooning , smart management , smart traffic management, smart emergency . 
-	And we can also create an electric vehicle and stations of charging the vehicle on the road.
