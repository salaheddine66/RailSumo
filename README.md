# RailSumo

Achievements: 

WHY SUMO : 
- Mature research platform 
- Open and Extensible
- Powerful toolbox for creating, running, analyzing simulations
- Run-time interaction with user code
- Active global user community
- Used world-wide, especially in the scientific community

SUMO â€“ Applications :

- Planning and evaluation / assessment
- Traffic management 
- Infrastructure changes
- Public transport
- New technologies (e.g. vehicular communication, automated transport systems)
- Optimization
- Traffic lights
- Routing
- Traffic forecast (short-term mostly)
- Data fusion for traffic surveillance

Public transport in SUMO :

 [public_transport](https://github.com/salaheddine66/RailSumo/issues/1#issue-699823002) 

How to chance and rebuild the scenario :


Tracks: 

Vehicle :

Simulation :

Signals :

Stations :

Schedule :





- Import of public transport data from OpenStreetMap
- Automation support for network correction
- Heuristic completion of missing schedule data
- Computing itineraries

Transport Network Tools : 


Interfacing  with traCI : 

-	TraCI could be accessed using multiple programming languages, with the most common language being Python. The package tools/TraCl in the SUMO simulator allows users to interact with SUMO using Python. This is advantageous as Python is already a well established script language for machine learning, providing useful libraries (such as Numpy and Pandas) whilst implementing a machine learning algorithm.

-	With this interfacing we can do a lot of things like : V2X , platooning , smart management , smart traffic management, smart emergency . 
-	And we can also create an electric vehicle and stations of charging the vehicle on the road.
